# ML Customer Buying Behavior

This project predicts customer purchase behavior using machine learning based on call center interactions. The goal is to identify customers likely to make a purchase, helping sales teams prioritize leads and optimize follow-ups.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a customer will make a purchase after interacting with a call center.
- **Dataset:** Real customer call interactions transformed into structured features.
- **Machine Learning Models Used:**
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Gradient Boosting (achieved highest accuracy)
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  2. Feature engineering from call center interactions.
  3. Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
  4. Model training and evaluation.
  5. Analysis of results and performance metrics.
